# Chrome extension search filter

This extension removes some SEO spam sites from Google search results.
Previously [search filter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-filter/eidhkmnbiahhgbgpjpiimdogfidfikgf) did this job beautifully. 
But recently it stopped working and that just became too annoying so I made a budget version.
